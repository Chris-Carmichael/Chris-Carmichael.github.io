      <description>Time to Blog I&#39;ve been into computers for over 30 years, since I was a teenager taking apart a Tandy 1000 EX. Yikes my mom was so mad. She threatened to take a broom to my good friend Jason and I if we didn&#39;t have it put back together by the morning. We succeeded, and I&#39;ve been addicted to technology ever since.
Professionally, I&#39;ve got ~20 years of experience. I recently had an opportunity to land an evangelist job talking about kubernetes, but the hiring manager couldn&#39;t find me online.</description>
